JINN is a simple, modern Portfolio theme with great fonts (Khula) developed by Aaron Snowberger specifically for http://aaronsnowberger.com

2. Custom colors
3. Header background color (3-color gradient)
4. Header text color
5. Optional Header image
6. Sidebar position: left, right, none (default) - this is also customizable on individual Pages

### Widget Areas

1. Sidebar
2. Footer
3. Sidebar Pages (only on Pages)
4. Sidebar Custom Post Types (only on Custom Post Types)

### Blockquotes

Blockquotes can be aligned left or right (in a similar way that images are) using the `"alignleft"` or `"alignright"` classes.
