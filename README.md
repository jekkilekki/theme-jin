JINN
===

JINN is a simple, modern Portfolio theme with great fonts (Khula) developed by Aaron Snowberger specifically for http://aaronsnowberger.com

## Features

### Post and Page Excerpts

Pages also have the ability to have excerpts as Posts do by default. This is because they are styled as a featured lead-in section of text before the auto and publication metadata. Simply add an excerpt to a Post or Page and watch the magic happen.

### Customizer Options

1. Custom colors
2. Custom logo and favicon
3. Header background color
4. Header text color
5. Optional Header image
6. Sidebar position: left, right, none (default) - this is also customizable on individual Pages

### Featured Images

Featured Images default to take the place of the Header Image on any page as well as show up below the Post meta within the main content. In a later version, the Featured Image in this section may be able to be replaced with embedded media or turned off.

### Widget Areas

1. Sidebar
2. Footer

### Blockquotes

Blockquotes can be aligned left or right (in a similar way that images are) using the `"alignleft"` or `"alignright"` classes.

### License

JINN is licensed under the GPLv2 Open Source license.

JINN is derived from the _s Components Portfolio (http://underscores.me) theme developed by Automattic.

Fonts used include:

1. Khula
2. FontAwesome
